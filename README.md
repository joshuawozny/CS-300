## Assignment One: [VectorSorting](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/VectorSorting)
This assignment is designed to explore sorting algorithms by implementing both a selection sort and quicksort of a vector of bids loaded from a CSV file. Refelction and Pseudocode [here](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents). 

## Assignment Two: [LinkedLists](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/LinkedList/LinkedList)
This assignment is designed to explore linked lists, we will implement a singly linked list to hold a collection of bids loaded from a CSV file. Refelction and Pseudocode [here](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents). 

## Assignment Three: [HashTables](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/HashTable/HashTable)
This assignment is designed to explore hash tables, we will implement a hash table using a vector of LinkedLists to hold a collection of bids loaded from a CSV file. Refelction and Pseudocode [here](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents). 

## Assignment Four: [BinarySearchTrees](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/BinarySearchTree/BinarySearchTree)
This assignment is designed to explore binary seacrh trees, we will implement a binary search tree using a node structure to hold bids loaded from a CSV file. Refelction and Pseudocode [here](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents).

## Milestone One: [Course Objects with vectors](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents)

This assignment explored how to open and parse a CSV file and creating objects to store each object that is described on each line of the imported file by developing an appropriate set of pseudocode, storing in a vector. 

## Milestone Two: [Course Objects with HashTables](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents)

This assignment explored how to open and parse a CSV file and creating course objects, each described on a single line of the imported file by developing an appropriate set of pseudocode, storing in a Hash Table

## Milestone Three: [Course Objects with BinarySearchTrees](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents)

This assignment explored how to open and parse a CSV file and creating course objects, each described on a single line of the imported file by developing an appropriate set of pseudocode, storing in a Binary Search Tree

## Project One: [Course Catolog Project Pseudocode comparing three Data Structures](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/main/Documents)

This project compared and contrasted each of the data structures we've explored in our Milestones. The project required us to provide an analysis using Big-O notation of the time and space complexity of each, and make a recomendation regarding which data structure should be used for the application and describe why.
