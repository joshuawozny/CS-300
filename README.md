# CS-300: DSA: Analysis and Design
## Assignment One
This assignment is designed to explore sorting algorithms by implementing both a selection sort and quicksort of a vector of bids loaded from a CSV file.

In this version, the following menu is presented when the program is run:

> Menu:<br>
> 1. Load Bids <br>
> 2. Display All Bids<br>
> 3. Selection Sort All Bids<br>
> 4. QuickSort All Bids<br>
> 5. Report Performance Difference<br>
> 9. Exit<br>
> Enter choice:<br>

This project implements the following functions that demonstrate these sorting algorithms.
* void selectionSort(vector& bids)
* void quickSort(vector& bids, int begin, int end)
* int partition(vector& bids, int begin, int end)
