# CS-300: DSA: Analysis and Design
## Assignment One: [VectorSorting](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/dsaProject/DSAproject/DSAproject)
This assignment is designed to explore sorting algorithms by implementing both a selection sort and quicksort of a vector of bids loaded from a CSV file. 

## Assignment Two: [LinkedLists](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/dsaProject/DSAproject/DSAproject)
This assignment is designed to explore linked lists, so you will implement a singly linked list to hold a collection of bids loaded from a CSV file. 


## Milestone One: [Course Objects](https://github.com/joshuawozny/CS-300/tree/dsaProject/DSAproject/Documents)

This assignment explored how to open and parse a CSV file and creating objects to store each object that is described on each line of the imported file by developing an appropriate set of pseudocode.
